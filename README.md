# Planned Pooling Web App

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Planned Pooling Web App**, a tool specifically designed for **crocheters** who want to experiment with **color patterns** and **yarns**. This web app allows users to explore the world of **intentional color pooling** by visualizing how different yarns and color combinations interact across a project. It helps you plan your crochet projects by showing you how colors will align and pool in a grid, giving you the opportunity to experiment and adjust your choices until you achieve the perfect pattern.

This app is inspired by the concept of **transitions**—the subtle, yet powerful changes that occur as one color morphs into another, much like the way a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. It allows users to experience and control these transitions, turning the sometimes unpredictable world of color pooling into a planned, manageable journey. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned crocheter, this tool will help you visualize your project before you start, making the creative process smoother and more enjoyable.

## Purpose and Features

The Planned Pooling Web App is designed for **crocheters** who want to visualize and plan color pooling projects. The app helps you experiment with different yarns and patterns, allowing you to perfect your crochet project before picking up the hook.

Key features include:

- **Live Yarn Preview**: Instantly see how different color combinations look when worked into a stitch grid.
- **Stitch Calculator**: Determine the perfect stitch count and pattern alignment for your yarn colors.
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Learn how to master color pooling with educational content, including a swatch calculator for finishing size.
- **Export to Excel**: Save your yarn combinations, stitch counts, and pattern details in an Excel file for easy reference.

## Target Audience

This web app is built for **crocheters** who want to experiment with color pooling techniques and create beautifully planned crochet projects. It’s ideal for:

- **Beginner Crocheters**: Those who are new to the concept of color pooling and want a tool to help plan their projects.
- **Seasoned Crocheters**: Experienced crafters who want to explore new color patterns and improve their color pooling skills.
- **Creative Makers**: Anyone who enjoys experimenting with yarn combinations and needs a visual guide to perfect their designs.

## How It Works

The app allows users to:
1. **Select Yarn Colors**: Choose from a variety of color options using a color picker.
2. **Input Stitch Counts**: Specify how many stitches per color to use, helping you maintain a consistent pattern throughout the project.
3. **Preview**: View the color pooling in real-time as the app calculates how the colors will interact with one another in the context of your project.
4. **Download**: Export your planned pattern into an Excel sheet to keep track of your work.

## Creative Vision: Transitions and Transformations

The theme of this web app is centered around the **transitions** and **transformations** that happen when color and stitch patterns evolve across a project. Just as metamorphosis transforms a caterpillar into a butterfly, this app transforms your raw material—the yarn—into a masterpiece. The dynamic grid visualizations serve as a metaphor for **evolution**—how tiny changes, stitch by stitch, come together to create something beautiful and intricate.

The user journey itself also mirrors a **personal transformation**: from confusion and uncertainty about how the yarn will behave in a project, to confidence and clarity through the real-time previews and guided input options.

## Utilizing GitHub Copilot

In developing this web app, I utilized **GitHub Copilot** as an essential tool for streamlining the development process. The autocomplete, suggestions, and context-aware code assistance provided by Copilot allowed me to:

- Accelerate the creation of complex JavaScript functions for the yarn preview and grid visualizations.
- Implement effective error handling and user input validation quickly.
- Develop key features like the Excel export functionality by generating precise and optimized code for handling data in the background.

This experience emphasized the importance of **transitions and transformations**, both in coding and in creative design, as Copilot helped me transform my ideas into a functional, interactive tool.


## Future Improvements

While this app is functional and ready to help users plan their color-pooling projects, future updates will include:
- Expanded yarn database with a broader range of brands and colors.
- Advanced pattern suggestions and algorithms to generate personalized recommendations.
- Mobile app version for easier access on-the-go.
- Improve Accesibility.
