        <h2>What is Planned Pooling?</h2>
        <p>Planned pooling is a crochet technique that transforms variegated yarn into stunning, intentional patterns. Variegated yarn alternates between different colors in repeating sequences, and by carefully aligning the number of stitches with the yarn's color changes, crocheters can create visually striking designs like argyle, stripes, or geometric motifs.
            <br><br>

            This technique involves:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Choosing the right yarn: Variegated yarn with consistent color repeats works best.</li>
                <li>Stitch math: Calculating the number of stitches per color segment to achieve the desired pattern.</li>
                <li>Precision and patience: Adjusting tension and stitch placement to keep the colors pooling predictably.</li>
                <li>The result is a mesmerizing fabric that looks intricate but is achievable with basic crochet skills and a little planning.</li>
            </ul>
        This app allows you to experiment with planned pooling by generating a live grid based on your color and stitch inputs. Have fun exploring different combinations and creating your own unique patterns!
